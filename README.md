In the dynamic field of machine learning, particularly in computer vision, the exploration of zero-shot learning stands out as a compelling and pivotal pursuit. Zero-shot learning presents a unique challenge by requiring neural network models to innovate and discern classes not encountered during training. This project's significance extends beyond technical intricacies, resonating in practical applications where adaptability and versatility are paramount.

Traditional computer vision models often struggle with recognizing new classes, making zero-shot learning crucial for more flexible and intelligent systems. The motivation behind this research is rooted in the transformative impact effective zero-shot learning models can have across various domains, such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and medical imaging.

Motivation:

The motivation for this research lies in the transformative impact that effective zero-shot learning models can have across various domains. Consider scenarios where machines must identify and classify novel objects in real-time, such as in autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, or medical imaging. The ability to recognize previously unseen classes is critical for the success and safety of these systems.

Furthermore, zero-shot learning has the potential to reduce dependency on extensive labeled datasets. Traditional supervised learning often requires copious labeled examples for each class, which may not always be feasible or cost-effective. Zero-shot learning, with its capacity to generalize to new classes without explicit examples, offers a promising solution to mitigate these challenges.
